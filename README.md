Helper to watch and autoreload Garden sources from REPL and outside as well.

In combination with [Figwheel][figwheel] gives you instant sync between your
[Garden][garden] sources and page in the browser

## Installation

Add garden-gnome as a dependency in project.clj (Leiningen) or build.boot (Boot).

`[garden-gnome "0.1.0"]`

## Configuration

Then say you have a namespace with your styles defined:

```clojure
(ns sample.styles
  (:require [garden.def :refer [defstyles]]))

(defstyles screen
  [:body {:background-color "black"}])
```

Add following configuration in your `project.clj` (same format as [lein-garden][lein-garden])

```clojure
:garden {:builds [{;; Source path where to watch for changes:
                   :source-path "dev/sample"
                   ;; The var containing your stylesheet:
                   :stylesheet  sample.styles/screen
                   ;; Compiler flags passed to `garden.core/css`:
                   :compiler    {:output-to     "resources/public/screen.css"
                                 :pretty-print? true}}]}
```

## One-time compilation

Use following command to compile all your configurations

```sh
$ lein run -m garden-gnome.compile
```

## Watching from shell

Use following command to compile all your configurations

```sh
$ lein run -m garden-gnome.watch
```

## Reloaded Workflow

Now in your REPL whenever you start you system, a watcher will start which
will observe changes in directories specified in your garden config and automatically
recompile mentioned namespaces whenever files change.

If you have [Figwheel][figwheel] set up, it will pick your changes automatically,
so will have a closed loop from editing garden code to seeing changes in your browser instantly.

### With [Mount][mount]  

```clojure
(ns user
  (:require [mount.core :as mount]
            [garden-gnome.watcher :as garden-gnome]))

(mount/defstate garden
  :start (garden-gnome/start! (garden-gnome/default-config))
  :stop (garden-gnome/stop! garden))
```

### With [Component][component]

```clojure
(ns user
  (:require [com.stuartsierra.component :as component]
            [garden-gnome.watcher :as garden-gnome]))

(defrecord Gnome []
  component/Lifecycle
  (start [this]
    (let [config  (garden-gnome/default-config)
          watcher (garden-gnome/start! config)]
      (assoc this :watcher watcher)))
  (stop [this]
    (let [watcher (:watcher this)]
      (garden-gnome/stop! watcher)
      (dissoc this :watcher))))
```
